Water is also important, as it \nmoderates temperature swings. At very low temperatures, oceans \nare actually glaciers for most of the year.\n \nAlthough the temperature on Mars can already reach \n20 ˚C on ’hot’ summer days, this is not enough. To enable liquid \noceans, the mean temperature has to be positive, at least at the \nequator.\n \nThe most important parameter for terraforming is \nthe oxygen level. Without a breathable atmosphere, Mars is not \nliveable, not terraformed. Earth’s oxygen content is 21% of the \natmosphere, 0.21 atm. At higher altitudes, this decreases as the \natmosphere becomes thinner. At 3000 m the oxygen level is 0.14 \natm and there are a few major cities at this altitude, mostly in the \nAndes and in China. The most notable examples are  the Bolivian \ncities El Alto (4150 m) and La Paz (3640 m), each with nearly a \nmillion inhabitants.\n \nEarth’s atmosphere also contains 78% nitrogen, the \nmain component responsible for air pressure. Air pressure is \nalso important, if not as crucial as oxygen level. Another aspect \nof terraforming is Mars’ very weak magnetic field. These aspects \nare not represented by a global parameter, but usually result in a \nhigher TR for the player, as indicated on the specific cards.\nTemperature, oxygen, and ocean are called global \nparameters. Whenever you raise one of them, your \nterraform rating also increases by that much, giving you a \nhigher income and score.\n \nWhen a global parameter has reached its goal, it \ncan’t be raised any further, and so does not increase your \nTR. You may still play cards and actions that increase the \nparameter - just ignore that part of the effect.\n \nWhen all three global parameters have reached \ntheir goal, the game ends after that generation (after the \nproduction phase).\nG L O B A L  PA R A M E T E R S\n \nIn Terraforming Mars, you control a corporation, \nand you buy and play cards describing different projects. \nThe projects often directly or indirectly contribute to the \nterraforming process, but can also consist of business \nenterprises of different kinds. In order to win, you have to \naccumulate a good terraform rating (TR) and many victory \npoints (VPs). Your TR is increased each time you raise a \nglobal parameter (temperature, oxygen or ocean). Your TR \ndetermines your basic income, as well as your basic score. As \nthe terraforming process proceeds, more projects become \nfeasible. Additional VPs are awarded for anything enhancing \nmankind’s grip on the solar system. This can be anything, \nfrom founding cities to building infrastructure, or protecting \nthe environment.\n \nTime is measured in generations, and each \ngeneration starts with a Turn Order phase, followed by a \nResearch phase, in which players access new cards. In the \nAction phase, players take turns doing 1 or 2 actions, going \naround the table until everyone has passed. Then, in the \nProduction phase, all players produce resources according to \ntheir production parameters on the player boards, and gain \nincome from their TR.\n \nThe central game board has tracks for temperature, \noxygen level, terraform rating, and generations. There is \na surface map where you add ocean tiles, greenery tiles, \nand city tiles as the game progresses. There is also a list of \nstandard projects available to all players, as well as milestones \nand awards that players can compete for.\n \nThe game ends when there is enough oxygen to \nbreathe (14 %), oceans enough to allow Earth-like weather \n(9), and the temperature is well above freezing (+8 ˚C). It will \nthen be possible, if not comfortable, to live on the surface of \nMars!\n \nThe winner is the player with most VPs \nat the end of the game. VPs come from your \nTR, your tiles on the game board, won awards, \nclaimed milestones, and VPs on cards you have \nplayed.", "type": "text"}], "errors": [], "timestamp": "2026-01-17T12:45:22.602026"}

This phase is \nskipped the first generation (see setup).\n2) Research phase\n \nEach player draws 4 cards and decides which of \nthem he wants to buy to his hand. Each card costs 3 M€ to \nbuy to the hand, and you may buy 0-4 cards. The rest of the \n4 drawn cards are discarded face down on the discard pile. \nThere is no hand limit.\n \nThis phase is also skipped the first generation (see \nsetup).\n \nExample: In the second generation, the players have \ntheir first normal research phase. They put down their hand \ncards and draw 4 cards each to buy from. Stanley decides to \nbuy 3 of his cards, so he pays 9 M€ and discards the remaining \ncard, adding the 3 new cards to his hand.\n3) Action phase (see page 9)\n \nPlayers take 1 or 2 actions each turn, or pass. Play \nproceeds clockwise around the table until all players have \npassed. The actions may be combined in any way the player \nchooses. The available actions are:\nA) Play a card from your hand (see page 9).\nB) Use a standard project (see page 10).\nC) Claim a milestone (see page 10).\nD) Fund an award (page 11).\nE) Use the action on a blue card (see page 11).\nF) Convert 8 plants into a greenery tile (which gives an oxy-\ngen increase) as described on the player board (see page 11).\nG) Convert 8 heat into a temperature increase as described \non the player board (see page 11).\n \nYou can choose to take 1 or 2 actions on your \nturn.

When everyone has passed, the action phase \nends.\n \nExample: Stanley starts the second generation action \nphase by using the standard project ’Sell patents’ (see page 10): \nhe discards a card to gain 1 M€ - he realized that that card \nwas not really helpful for his situation. Plus, he wants to see \nwhat the others do before deciding his own course of action.\nAfter that, Robinson uses the standard project City and pays \n25 M€ to place a city and increase his M€ production 1 step. \nBeing Tharsis Republic, this gives him another M€ produc-\ntion and 3 M€ back, besides the normal tile placement bonus. \nContent with just one action, he tells Kim to start her turn.\nKim plays the space project Asteroid Mining at a cost of 30 \nM€, spending 8 titanium (it’s a space project). Because of \nPhoboLog’s effect, each titanium is worth 4 M€,  which makes \na total of 32 M€. She could have \npayed 7 titanium plus 2 M€, but she \npays 8 anyway because she’s low \non cash. Asteroid Mining allows \nKim to increase her titanium \nproduction 2 steps, so she adjusts \nthat parameter on her player \nboard, and then places the \ncard before her. Kim decides \nto play another space card as \nher second action, spending \nmore titanium in the process, \nbefore giving the turn to Stanley, \nwho now has decided to go for Geothermal Power. \nThat card has a power tag and costs 11 M€, but because \nStanley has the corporation ThorGate, with a discount effect \nfor power cards, he only needs to pay 8 M€ for it.\nAnd so the turn continues around until everyone is out by \ndoing no actions.\n4) Production phase\n \nAll players perform this phase simultaneously. \nFirst, all energy is converted into heat (move all resource \ncubes from the energy box to the heat box). Secondly, all \nplayers receive new resources:\n \nPlayers get M€ according to their terraform rating \nplus any M€ production (which may be negative!), then the \nplayers also get any other resources they have production of \naccording to the player board. Place all generated resources \nin their corresponding boxes. (See page 6)\n \nFinally, remove player markers from used action \ncards, to mark that they may be used again next generation \n(see page 11).\n \nNow you are ready to start the next generation.\n \nExample: Kim gains 21 M€ from her TR and M€ \nproduction. She also produces 3 titanium resources (because \nshe played Asteroid Mining earlier), and 1 each of the other \nresources, adding them on her player board.", "type": "text"}], "errors": [], "timestamp": "2026-01-17T12:45:22.602026"}

Choosing only 1 action can be useful \ntoo - it can be used for waiting out your opponents or just to \ndo a no-brainer while thinking about your more important \ndecisions.\nA) Play a card from your hand\nWhen playing a card, there are 3 steps to consider:\n \n1) Check the requirements.\n \n2) Pay for the card and get any immediate effects.\n \n3) Place the card appropriately.\n1) Check the requirements.\n \nIn order to play a card you must meet its require-\nments and be able to perform the effects stated on the card, \nwith the following exceptions: You may play a card that...\n \n- raises global parameters that have already reached \ntheir goal (for example when there are no more ocean tiles, or \nwhen the temperature is at +8 °C).\n \n- adds resources that you can’t collect (for example \nadding microbe resources without having any microbe \nproject to place them on).\n \n-removes resources for any player (red-bordered \nresource icons, see example on card C below) if you can’t or \ndo not wish to.\nEven if these effects can’t be performed, you may still play the \ncard, performing all other effects as usual.\n \nExample: Kim can play Asteroid (card C) even if the \ntemperature has reached its goal, but then she gets no TR. She \nmay also choose not to remove any plants at all, or just do it \npartly (maybe only Kim herself has plants, or maybe Stan-\nley or Robinson have less than 3 plants to remove). All plants \nmust be taken from the same player, though.\n \nCards A, B, D and E below each have a requirement \nlisted next to the card’s cost. To play card A, you need to \nhave titanium production. To play card B, the oxygen level \nneeds to be 9% or lower, and you also need to have energy \nproduction since the card requires you to decrease your \nenergy production. To play card D, the oxygen level must be \n9% or higher. You also need to have plant production, since \nthe card requires you to decrease your plant production. \nCard E requires 5% oxygen and energy production.\n \nThe cost required to play the card is stated in the \nupper left corner. Some blue cards already in play may \ngive you a discount (for example, E gives a discount when \nplaying a space card). You may also use steel and titanium to \nhelp pay for building and space cards respectively.\n2) Paying and performing immediate effects.\n \nFirst you must pay the card’s cost.\n \nThen the lower panel of the card shows you any \nimmediate effects. These effects (and other effects triggered \nby the card you just played) are performed in any order you \nchoose.\n \nAny production (see brown boxes on cards A, \nB, D & E) must be performed.  Resources or production \nwith  a red frame means that you can affect any player you \nchoose (even yourself). Resources or production without \nred frames always affect yourself and must be performed. \nSo card A essentially steals a titanium production from an \nopponent, while in B, D and E you must decrease your own \nenergy or plant production in order to increase your M€ \nproduction.\n \nCards may also feature tiles and tags with a red \nborder. A ’red’ tile means any player’s tile, and a ’red’ tag \nmeans any player’s tag.", "type": "text"}], "errors": [], "timestamp": "2026-01-17T12:45:22.602026"}

A milestone may only be claimed by one player, and only \n3 of the 5 milestones may be claimed in total, so there is a \nrace for these!

Again, \na red border means you can choose the resources of any \none player, so playing card C is usually not very nice. Red-\nbordered resources are optional, so card C does not remove \nyour own plants, even if you are the only player that has \nany plant resources. Non-standard resources (that are not \ncollected on your player board) are instead collected on \nspecific cards (D). By default, those resources are usually \nplaced on the same card that generates them. Livestock (Card \nD), for example, gains 1 animal (resource cube) on it when \nyou use its action (actions can be used once per generation).\n \nAny tiles (B) placed by the card follow the rules for \ntiles (see page 5). A tile must be placed if possible, but being \nunable to do so does not prevent you from playing the card.\n \nIf a card has a (*), then it is an exception to the \nnormal rules, and you must read the explanation in \nparenthesis to see details of how the card works.\n \nIf you ever become uncertain of a card’s function, \nread the explanation text.\n \nVP icons (see cards A, D, E) are ignored for now, \nthey will be counted in the final scoring (see page 12). Card \nD may be worth several VPs if its action (top panel) has had \ntime to work a few times to add more animal resources to the \ncard.\n3) Place the card (see illustration below).\n \nEvents (red cards, C) are collected in a personal pile \nface down after being played. Their tags only apply while \nbeing played (for example using the discount on card E when \nplaying a space event).\n \nAutomated cards (green, A, B) are placed face up in \na stack on the table with only the top row visible. They have \nno further effect, but since they represent the current extent \nof your operations, their tags still apply.\n \nActive cards (blue, D, E) have ongoing effects that \nmay trigger at any time, or actions that you can use (just \nlike the corporations). Since you need to keep track of these \ncards, they are placed with the top panel visible.\n \nMany cards represent ideas for terra-\nforming. They may affect the global parameters or give \nyou a higher TR in other ways. They may represent \nphotosynthesising organisms releasing oxygen, or heat \nsources that gradually raise the temperature.\n \nThere are also other cards that are interlinked \nwith the terraforming process, either requiring some \nterraforming to have been done, or specializing in early \nconditions.\n \nEach card has a flavor text that may help you \nget a feeling for what the card does ’in reality’.\nEVENT PILE", "type": "text"}], "errors": [], "timestamp": "2026-01-17T12:45:22.602026"}

The player markers will be removed during \nthe production phase.\n \nExample: Towards the end of the game, Stanley has \nLivestock (card D) in play. He can choose its action on his \nturn, adding a resource cube (an ’animal’) to that card, and \nplacing a player marker on it.\n \nBlue cards may also have effects that are always ac-\ntive, like Shuttles (Card E): When you play a space card, it \ncosts 2 M€ less. These effects are not actions (no red arrow), \nso you can always use them.\nF) Convert plants into greenery\n \n8 plant resources may be turned into a greenery \ntile, which increases oxygen level 1 step (and therefore also \nyour TR 1 step).\n \nNote that the greenery tile must be placed next to \nanother of your tiles (if possible) and may generate place-\nment bonuses (see page 5).\n \nExample: Robinson removes 8 plant resources from \nhis plant box on the player board, increasing oxygen level 1 \nstep, and raising his terraform rating 1 step as well.

We do not recommend it for players new to \nTerraforming Mars.\nSolo variant for Corporate Era:\n \nAll rules apply as usual for solo play, with these \nexceptions:\n1) Before you choose your cards, place 2 neutral city tiles \non the map with an adjacent greenery tile each (these tiles \nare not yours, and do not increase the oxygen level): reveal \nand discard the 4 top cards of the deck and use their cost \nnumbers to determine the positions of the tiles.

Then you place the two \ngreeneries by counting the cost numbers and stepping \nclockwise around each city, starting from top left, skipping \nillegal placements.\nSpecial case: If you choose to play Tharsis Republic this \ngame, you get M€ production for the 2 neutral cities even \nthough they are placed before you reveal your corporation.\n2) Start with a terraform rating of 14 instead of 20 (marked \n’solo’ on the track) and without the extra production of \nresources decribed for the standard game.\n3) Awards and Milestones are not used.\n4) You have a neutral opponent that you can steal from, or \nreduce any kind of resources and production from.\n5) You always play 14 generations (marked ’solo’).\nIn order to win, you need to complete terraforming (i.e \nmaking the three global parameters reach their goal) before \nthe end of generation 14. After generation 14, you may \nconvert plants into greenery tiles, following normal rules \nbut without raising the oxygen, and finally you score VPs \nto get as high a score as possible. If you have not completed \nterraforming by the end of generation 14, you lose.\nDraft variant:\n \nIf more interaction is desired, the Draft variant \nmay be used. During the Research phase the players draft 4 \ncards to buy from instead of just drawing 4 to buy from:\n \nEach player first gets 4 cards and chooses one to \ndraft, putting it aside and passing the rest to the next player. \nThen you have 3 cards; set aside 1 of them and pass the rest \nto the left. Then set aside 1 of the 2 you receive, pass the last \ncard, and finally receive your last card.\n \nThen examine the 4 cards you’ve set aside (drafted) \nand choose which to buy (3 M€ each) and which to discard.\n \nDrafting is not used during the first generation \nsince the first Research phase is skipped (see setup). Cards \nare passed clockwise during even-numbered generations \nand counter-clockwise during odd-numbered generations.\n \nThis variant allows players to affect which cards \nother players get access to, and increases your ability to \npursue a certain strategy, or predict which parameter will \nrise first.\n \nThe Draft Variant adds some extra game time and \nis not recommended for players new to Terraforming Mars.\nAbout the author:\n \nJacob Fryxelius got his doctoral degree in \nchemistry at Stockholm University in 2006.

VPs are scored for your \nTerraform rating, from tiles on the map, from \nMilestones and Awards, and from many of the \ncards.\nParameters\n \nTerraforming Mars is about making Mars earth-\nlike enough to live freely on it. There are 4 parameters on \nthe game board connected to this process: Terraform rating, \ntemperature, oxygen level and ocean coverage.\nTerraform Rating (TR) is the measure of how \nmuch you have contributed to the terraforming \nprocess. Each time you raise the oxygen level, the \ntemperature, or place an ocean tile, your TR increases as well. \nEach step of TR is worth 1 VP at the end of the game, and the \nTerraforming Committee awards you income according to \nyour TR. You start at 20.\nThe mean temperature at the equator is raised 2 \n˚C at a time from -30˚C to +8˚C. This will create \nan equatorial zone where water stays liquid. This \nsymbol means that you raise the temperature 1 step, \nand therefore you also increase your TR 1 step.\nThe oxygen level is measured as a percentage of \nan atm of pressure, meaning that this percentage \nis comparable to Earth’s 21% oxygen. At 14% the \natmosphere resembles that of Earth at a 3000 m \nelevation. This symbol means that you raise the oxygen level \n1 step, and therefore also increase your TR 1 step.\nEach ocean tile represents 1% ocean coverage. \nWith 9% of the surface covered by oceans, Mars \nwill have a hydrological cycle, creating rain and \nrivers. This symbol means that you place an ocean \ntile, and therefore also increase your TR 1 step (and get any \nplacement bonus, see page 5).\nResources\n \nAll resources are represented by resource cubes. \nThese come in 3 sizes; 1 (bronze), 5 (silver) and 10 (gold) and \ncan be used as any kind of resource. Where you place them \ndetermines what they are. The six standard resources are \nmegacredits, steel, titanium, plants, energy and heat, and \nthey are all collected on the player board. Certain cards can \nalso collect resources (usually animal and microbe cards, see \ntags on next page). If a card adds a non-standard resource, it \nis generally placed on that same card.\nThe MegaCredit (M€) is the general currency used for \nbuying and playing cards and using standard projects, \nmilestones, and awards.\nSteel represents building material on Mars. Usually \nthis means some kind of magnesium alloy. Steel is \nused to pay for building cards, being worth 2 M€ per \nsteel.\nTitanium represents resources in space or for the \nspace industry. Titanium is used to pay for space \ncards, being worth 3 M€ per titanium.\nPlants use photosynthesis. As an action, 8 plant \nresources can be converted into a greenery tile that \nyou place on the board. This increases the oxygen \nlevel (and your TR) 1 step. Each greenery is worth 1 \nVP and generates 1 VP to each adjacent city tile (see \nmap rules on page 5).\nEnergy is used by many cities and industries. This \nusage may either be via an action on a blue card, or \nvia a decrease in energy production. Leftover energy \nis converted into heat.\nHeat warms up the Martian atmosphere. As an action, \n8 heat resources may be spent to increase temperature \n(and therefore your TR) 1 step.\nOther resources (including animals and microbes) are \ncollected on their respective cards, which also define \nwhat they do.\nProduction of a resource is depicted by having the \nresource symbol in a brown production box. In \nthis example the symbol means that you increase \nyour plant production parameter on your player \nboard 1 step. This in turn will give you a steady income \nof plant resources. Production is not limited to 10; if your \nproduction exceeds 10, just leave the marker on 10 and start \na new marker to complement it.\nOnly M€ production can be negative (only as far as -5, \nthough). But since TR is added to your production, your \ntotal income will not be negative.\nCards represent huge endeavors that players may \nundertake.
