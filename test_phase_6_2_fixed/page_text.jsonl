Each circle on a triggerable mission can only be \ncovered once.\nNote: It is possible to trigger some missions even \noutside of your turn.\nIf one effect would trigger multiple rewards (it can be on the same card or on different cards), you may choose to cover any of those \nspaces, but only a single space can be covered at a time. You will need to trigger the mission again in order to cover another space.\nOnce all of the spaces have been covered, the mission is automatically completed – keep it face down in front of you with the other \ncompleted missions.\nCards refer to your stuff and things \nyou have done or have to do, unless \nexplicitly stated otherwise.\nEXAMPLE: If your probe is at Mercury when \nyou play the Mariner 10 Mission card, nothing \nhappens. It can trigger only when you move to \nMercury's space (or Venus's). Even if it triggers, \nyou don't have to use the effect. For example, \nif your probe moves to Venus but you already \nhave 10 publicity, you might decide to save that \neffect for the next time you visit Venus. Or you \ncould waste the publicity just for the sake of \nmarking that space.

Probe figures will rotate with the discs. \nHowever, because of cutouts in the discs, sometimes a figure may not move even though the \nplanets in its ring move. Other times, a figure in a cutout may be bumped by a rotating disc. In \nthis case, the figure is pushed into the next space. (Such movement is always free and if that \nspace gives publicity, the probe's owner gains that publicity immediately.)\nThe rotation counter reminds \nyou which disc to rotate.

All the discs and the probe \nmove with it.\nIf you are the first person to take a tech from that stack, discard the 2-point tile and \nscore 2 points immediately.\nEach tech has a bonus printed on it. Gain this bonus immediately. Then flip the tile over \nand place it on your board.\n16", "type": "text"}], "errors": [], "timestamp": "2025-12-20T17:34:27.435022"}

If there are multiple ways to fly to that planet using the moves \nprovided, choose the flight plan that gives the most publicity.\nFinally, the probe becomes a lander or an orbiter:\nIf the planet has a moon with an available space, the \nrival will first try to discard one of their probe \ntechnologies to land on it. If multiple moons are \navailable, the rival chooses the leftmost or rightmost, depending on the \ndecision arrow.\nIf the rival does not land on a moon, the rival tries to take the first \norbiter space or the first lander space on the planet. If both first \nspaces are available, or if neither is, the rival defers to the action \ncard instead. (For example, the rival prefers orbiters in this case:\n  \n.)\nEither way, give the rival any points, resources, and life traces earned \nfrom the orbiter or lander.\nORBITER / LANDER\nTELESCOPE\nMark your rival's signals as shown by the action. For signals from the card row, use the decision arrow \nto determine whether the leftmost or rightmost cards will be chosen.\nIf the rival has a telescope tech tile, they discard it and mark an extra signal from the card row.\nAfter the rival has finished marking signals from the card row, replace the discarded cards with new \ncards from the top of the deck.\nIf a signal could be marked in multiple different sectors, the \nrival chooses a sector for their signal based on the following \nlogic:\n1.\t If by marking the signal the rival would win a sector, \nthe rival chooses that sector.\n2.\t If no such sector can be won, the rival instead checks to \nsee if marking a signal can score points for marking \nthe second signal in a sector.\n3.\t If no sector can be won or score points, the rival chooses \nthe sector where they have the most markers.\nFor each of these steps, in the event of a tie, the rival favors \nthe bigger sector (the sector that can contain the most data).\nThere are no circumstances that would make a Telescope \naction impossible for the rival to perform.\nLIFE TRACES – \n \n \nWhenever your rival earns a life trace, look \nat that column for each alien species. Your \nrival marks the lowest available space in that \ncolumn. (They ignore the overflow space below \nthe column, unless all other spaces are full.)\nWith \n, the rival considers all available \ncolumns.\nIf the spaces in the selected columns are \nequally low, choose the leftmost or rightmost, \ndepending on the decision arrow.\nEXAMPLE: The rival (white) is trying to mark a \n signal.\n1. Neither sector can be won.\n2. There is nowhere to score points.\n3. So the rival chooses the sector where they have the most markers.\n25", "type": "text"}], "errors": [], "timestamp": "2025-12-20T17:34:27.435022"}

Then resolve the new card.\nIf that alien species hasn't been discovered yet, skip this action and try the next action on the \ncard instead.\nThe rival can only take this action when their computer is full. If the rival computer is not full, \nskip this action and try the next action on the card instead.\nRemove all data from the rival computer (not the data pool), and give the rival the benefit \nshown on the action card. The rival also gains a \n as shown on their player board.\nIf the rival has any data tokens in their data pool afterwards, the rival then places as much data as possible into their computer, \nimmediately gaining the benefits of any spaces they cover as they do so.\nIf the rival has a computer tech, they discard it and gain 3 points and 1 progress. (Even if the rival has multiple computer techs, they \ncan only discard one.)\nOBJECTIVES  \b\nEach objective has one or more tasks. When you complete a task, mark it. When all \ntasks are marked, you have completed the objective.\nAt the end of your turn, move all completed objectives into a completed-objectives \npile near your board and replace them with new ones from the stack. You will always \nhave 3 objectives to work on until the stack \nruns out.\nAt the end of rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4, before \ngetting income, spend completed objectives \nequal to the round that just ended. (That is, \nremove 1, 2, 3, or 4 tiles from your pile of \ncompleted objectives.)

Your rival scores 5 points for each uncompleted objective.\n1-star difficulty has no objectives. Your rival does not progress on the progress track for \nuncompleted objectives between rounds, nor gain points for them at the end of the game.\nIf the rival starts a turn with no cards left in the action deck, they pass. Shuffle all rival’s played action cards and create a face-down \naction deck for the next round. Remove the top card from the end-of-round stack – don't forget that taking this card makes the rival \nadvance 1 space on the progress track. If the rival was the first to pass that round, don't forget to rotate the solar system as well.\nNote: \nJust \nlike \ntriggerable \nmissions, you can only ever place \none marker from a single trigger. \nFor example, if you have \n \non one objective and \n on \nanother, choose one objective to \nmark. You cannot mark both with \nthe same tech research.\nSOLO GAME\n26", "type": "text"}], "errors": [], "timestamp": "2025-12-20T17:34:27.435022"}

(Does not include probes still on the solar system board.)\n in a sector: Mark a signal. (The card will specify where.)\n Discard two cards from the card row and mark a signal \nin a matching sector for each of them. Replenish the card row \nafterwards.\n Mark a signal matching this color.\n A win in a sector of this color.\n A win in a sector.\nMove within the same ring: A move that does not change \nyour distance from the sun.\n you have: a \n, \n, or \n life trace you have \nmarked.\nDiscard a card for its signal: Discard a card from your hand. \nCheck the card's upper-right corner and mark a signal in a \nmatching sector.\nVisit a planet: To move a probe onto the space with the planet. \nEvents that trigger “when you visit” do not trigger if you already \nhave a probe on that space when you play the card.\nSETUP REMINDERS  \b\n \n} \u0007For 3-player games, use the two neutral milestones at 20 \nand 30 points, with one nonplayer marker on each.\n \n} \u0007For 2-player games, use the two neutral milestones at 20 \nand 30 points, with two nonplayer marker on each.\n \n} \u00071 point for the first player, 2 points for the second player, \nand so on.\n \n} \u0007Take your initial income card and gain resources based on it.\nFAQ  \b\nHow does ignoring the limit of probes in space work?\nIf a card gives you a Launch action and specifically says you can \nignore limits on probes in space, then you ignore your limits, but \nonly for that action. (Later launches must respect the limit.)\nCan I exchange two different resources, say a card and \nan energy for one credit?\nNo, this is not possible. Only two resources of one kind can be \ntraded for another resource. However, alien cards in your hand \nare considered as cards, so you can discard 1 card and 1 alien \ncard to get 1 credit. (Exception: Exertian alien cards are not in \nyour hand and are not discardable.)\nAfter I win a sector, will the marker I leave there help me \nwin that sector again later?\nNo. That marker is only there to show you've won the sector before.\nWill I get \n if the solar system pushes my probe onto a \nspace with a comet?\nYes. Your probes will always give you \n when they visit a \nspace object, even if it isn't your turn.\nI ran out of markers. Can I still take a Scan action?\nYes. There is no limit to the number of markers a player can have. \nIf you run out, find a suitable replacement.
